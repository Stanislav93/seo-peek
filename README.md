# SEO Peek
A browser extension for Chrome

Just one click to get a quick peek into on-page SEO factors of the web page you visit in the browser.

## Checking the DOM
SEO Peek is a Chrome extension that checks the Document Object Model (DOM) of a page. There is no need to view the HTML source (View Source for SEO is dead) or inspect the DOM in the elements tab of Chrome DevTools.

SEO Peek checks the most relevant content elements and robot directives inside the DOM of both traditional server-side generated pages and client-side rendered pages like Single Page Applications (SPA).
